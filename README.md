- Create a new database connection with the same name of your subdomain in the file config/database.php:

```bash 
'tenant1' => [
            'driver' => 'mysql',
            'host' => env('DB_HOST', 'localhost'),
            'port' => env('DB_PORT', '3306'),
            'database' => 'tenant1', //name of database 
            'username' => 'root',
            'password' => 'root',
            'charset' => 'utf8',
            'collation' => 'utf8_unicode_ci',
            'prefix' => '',
